# Task: Make all department component cards auto replay

## Completed Steps
- [x] Analyzed the all-department component structure (HTML, TS, CSS)
- [x] Identified that horizontal sliding animation was already present on desktop but disabled on mobile
- [x] Added vertical sliding animation keyframe for mobile devices
- [x] Modified mobile responsive CSS to enable auto replay with vertical sliding
- [x] Ensured continuous looping animation on all screen sizes

## Summary
The department cards now auto replay continuously:
- Desktop: Horizontal sliding with infinite loop
- Mobile: Vertical sliding with infinite loop
- Animation duration: 30 seconds per cycle
- Smooth linear transitions for seamless replay
